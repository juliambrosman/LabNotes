###Reciprocal BLAST analysis notes:

pwd
/Users/juliambrown/Desktop/MetaviromicData/recipblasts/wc_split_fasta_files

I have run BLASTs of the sediment libraries against the de-replicated WC library and created two libraries:
the sequences with BLAST matches to WC, and those without that I intend to submit to metavir
I ran into a snag with one library because metavir found it to have low complexity reads, so I am now
running the sequences through a QC software (prinseq) which is a web-based sequence analysis tool

On "upload a new dataset page" choosing options:
Basic:
	Length distribution
	GC content
	Occurrence of N
Fast processing:
	Sequence duplication (exact only)
	Assembly quality measure
Slow processing:
	Sequence complexity

"On Process Input Data" page selections:
Maximum number of allowed Ns: 0
Dereplicate data: "Remove exact sequence duplicates"
Sequence complexity related filters: 
	Method: DUST
	Low-complexity threshold: 49
Output data:
	FASTA
	Data passing all filters (good)

MetaVir upload worked only when using the unzipped file.  Good to know for the next time...
